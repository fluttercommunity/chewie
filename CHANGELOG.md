  **Slight Breaking Change**. Instead of:
  
  ```dart
  typedef ChewieRoutePageBuilder = Widget Function(
  	  BuildContext context,
  	  Animation<double> animation,
      Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
      _ChewieControllerProvider controllerProvider,
  );
  ```
  
  It is now:
  
  ```dart
  typedef ChewieRoutePageBuilder = Widget Function(
  	  BuildContext context,
  	  Animation<double> animation,
      Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
      ChewieControllerProvider controllerProvider,
  );
  ```
  
  TL;DR: We had to make `_ChewieControllerProvider` public.
